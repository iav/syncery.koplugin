--
-- WHAT THIS FILE DOES
--
-- One pure decision: given the "best" reading position from some OTHER
-- device (the candidate the `checkRemote` loop found in the shared
-- progress file), should we raise a jump prompt for it, or stay quiet?
--
-- This logic lives here, not inline inside `main.lua:checkRemote` where
-- it would tangle with KOReader UI access, so the decision is a pure,
-- deterministic function that can be unit-tested in isolation —
-- the path had NO test, which is precisely why a real defect (the old
-- `r_rev <= self.own_revision` gate) survived undetected.
--
-- WHY IT LIVES IN syncery_ui/ (NOT syncery_progress/)
--
-- "Should we interrupt the read with a jump prompt?" is a UI/interaction
-- POLICY, not a data concern.  `syncery_progress/` is a pure
-- data-merging engine and must not carry UI concerns: attaching these
-- thresholds to the `Progress` namespace would conflate "where the data
-- is" with "what the human-attention threshold is".  Keeping the policy
-- (and its thresholds) here,
-- beside the jump-prompt rendering (`jump_toast.lua`), keeps the data
-- engine clean.
--
--
-- THE TWO QUESTIONS
--
-- A jump prompt is worth raising only when BOTH hold:
--
--   1. RE-PROMPT SUPPRESSION — we have not already shown the user this
--      remote device at this revision (or newer).  We track, per remote
--      device, the highest revision we have already prompted about (and
--      the user acknowledged, by jumping or staying).  This is keyed
--      PER DEVICE because `revision` is a per-device monotonic counter
--      (`upsert_local_entry` bumps only the writing device's own key) —
--      so "device B at revision 5" and "device C at revision 5" are
--      unrelated states, and a single global threshold cannot compare
--      them.  Revision ALONE is enough to order one device's states;
--      timestamp would only matter under a device_id collision (two
--      physical devices sharing one id), which is a separate pathology.
--
--   2. SUBSTANTIVE DELTA — the remote position actually differs from
--      ours by enough to be worth a jump.  Tiny percent wobble is
--      ignored (PERCENT_EPSILON); small-but-real percent moves still
--      don't warrant a prompt unless the xpath (DOM anchor, rolling
--      docs) genuinely changed (SYNC_TRIGGER_DELTA).
--
-- The caller owns the acked map (it lives on the plugin instance and is
-- reset per book in onReaderReady) and updates it when the user
-- acknowledges a prompt.  This module never mutates it.
--
-- =============================================================================

local JumpPolicy = {}

-- Percent below this is treated as "no movement" (identical positions).
JumpPolicy.PERCENT_EPSILON    = 0.001

-- Small-but-real percent moves below this don't warrant a prompt on
-- their own — only if the xpath (rolling-doc DOM anchor) also changed.
JumpPolicy.SYNC_TRIGGER_DELTA = 0.005

-- How long after open/resume the session recency baseline stays alive
-- (seconds).  Within this grace window the reader may flip pages to orient
-- without forfeiting an incoming jump; after it the device's own recency is
-- honest again and the baseline is dropped.  Sized for the worst realistic
-- delivery chain: scheduled pull + a cold-probe backoff step or two + the
-- transfer -- and, with wake-on-open, the Wi-Fi raise itself (10-30 s).

--- Is position (b_percent, b_xpath) a SUBSTANTIVE move away from

--- Pick which OTHER device's position to offer as a jump target.
---
--- Pick which device's position to offer as a FORWARD jump target — or nil.
---
--- Two questions, one answer: WHICH device (recency) and WHETHER to offer
--- at all (direction).  Both are recency questions, so they collapse into a
--- single ranking:
---
---   Rank EVERY device — INCLUDING this one — by recency, then return the
---   winner ONLY IF it is not us.  If WE are the most-recently-read, there
---   is nothing newer to offer; an older device would be a BACKWARD jump,
---   suppressed by default.  Otherwise the winner is, by construction, newer
---   than us = a forward jump.
---
--- Why RECENCY, not save-count, not furthest: a per-device revision
--- counter measures how OFTEN a device saved, not how RECENTLY, so ranking
--- by it surfaces the chattiest device.  Why FORWARD-only by recency, not by
--- percent: "forward" means NEWER, not "further in the document" —
--- re-reading legitimately moves you backward in percent, and you still want
--- your most-recent spot, not a stale further one.  The guiding principle —
--- "forward means newer, not necessarily ahead in the document" — is why we
--- order by recency, not by percent, and why backward (older) is suppressed by
--- default.  Syncery's revision is a per-device save-count, not a logical
--- clock, so we rank the jump target by `timestamp` directly, not by revision.
---
--- Our own recency comes from our own entry in the passed map (the shared
--- progress file already includes it — no extra plumbing).  If we have no
--- entry (never saved here) we are simply never the winner, so any device
--- with a real read is offered.
---
--- Pure: no I/O, no mutation.  We deliberately do NOT touch `Merge.pick_best`
--- (its other caller — the conflict resolver's "which device wrote this
--- file" attribution — wants last-writer-by-(revision,timestamp), a
--- different, cosmetic need).  Backward sync could later become an opt-in.
---
--- Order within the ranking: timestamp DESC, then percent DESC, then
--- device_id (only to make exact ties deterministic).
---
--- @param entries table|nil { [device_id] = entry }, freshness-filtered, INCLUDING this device's own entry.
--- @param our_device_id string|nil this device's id — the recency baseline AND the "don't offer ourselves" guard.
--- @param our_recency_ts number|nil Rank OUR OWN entry by THIS timestamp
---        instead of its live one.  During a session our own autosave keeps
---        re-stamping our entry "most recent", which would forever outrank a
---        peer state that arrived (open-moment cloud pull) seconds after we
---        opened — so the caller passes the SESSION-START timestamp: "forward
---        means newer than what this reader has actually seen", not newer
---        than our latest autosave.  nil = legacy ranking (live timestamp).
--- @return table|nil The most-recently-read OTHER entry when it is newer than us (forward), else nil.
--- @return string|nil Its device_id (the map key).

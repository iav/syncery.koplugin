--
-- The plugin-facing transport glue: the cloud upload/schedule logic
-- for the plugin.
--
-- WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODULE, NOT METHODS ON THE ORCHESTRATOR
--
-- The obvious relocation target, `syncery_transports/orchestrator.lua`,
-- is the transport
-- *contract* Orchestrator — a deliberately plugin-agnostic, `.new()`-
-- constructed, fake-tested class that holds registered transports and
-- nothing else.  The helpers below are the opposite: they read many
-- distinct plugin members (`plugin._transport`, `plugin.use_cloud`,
-- `plugin:getCurrentState`, the cloud status fields —).  Making them
-- methods of the contract Orchestrator would pull plugin concerns into
-- a module whose entire value is being plugin-agnostic.
--
-- So the ad-hoc transport glue lives in a new sibling module instead,
-- out of main.lua.  Every function here takes the plugin instance as
-- its first parameter — the exact pattern `syncery_lifecycle/teardown.lua`
-- already uses.
--
-- PUBLIC SURFACE
--
--   PluginSync.schedule_cloud_upload(plugin, state)
--   PluginSync.do_cloud_upload(plugin, state)
--
-- main.lua keeps one-line delegator methods (`_scheduleCloudUpload`, etc.)
-- so existing call sites — `_save`, `teardown.lua` — are unchanged.

-- Content-hash push cache (Fix 4, confirmed via the two-device
-- investigation harness's Scenario 2b): do_cloud_upload had no
-- content-diff check at all -- a book re-added to .opened (which _save
-- does on EVERY successful write, regardless of whether anything
-- meaningfully changed) got its FULL current content re-read and
-- re-pushed unconditionally, even when byte-identical to what was
-- already successfully staged last time. Mirrors the EXISTING
-- manifest-upload skip pattern (pl_skip_upload, cached_our_hash, further
-- down in sync_all) -- same "hash what we're about to send, compare to
-- last time, skip if unchanged" shape, applied here to the per-book,
-- per-kind push instead of the whole-library manifest.
--
-- Deliberately as optimistic/fire-and-forget as the manifest cache it
-- mirrors: the cache is written right after DISPATCH, not after a
-- confirmed remote success (do_cloud_upload has no way to know that --
-- see Fix 1 elsewhere in this design). A push that is dispatched but
-- fails outright would leave the cache saying "already sent" for
-- content that never actually arrived -- an accepted, explicit
-- narrowing of scope for THIS fix; Fix 1 is what should eventually
-- close that gap, not this cache.

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Fix 1: do_cloud_upload dispatches the
--- push and returns "dispatched" immediately -- it has no way to know
--- whether the underlying push actually reached the server or failed
--- mid-flight (a genuine network error, not the upfront-unreachable case
--- "deferred" already covers). pushOpenedBooks used to treat
--- "dispatched" as success unconditionally, clearing the book from
--- .opened even when the push had genuinely failed -- with no retry
--- queued anywhere the user's next manual Sync Now would reach (the
--- Orchestrator's OWN internal backoff DOES still retry it, but only if
--- the app stays running long enough for that in-memory timer to fire;
--- closing/suspending KOReader loses it, since nothing re-queues .opened
--- once it thinks the book already succeeded).
---
--- Fix: read the Orchestrator's ALREADY-MAINTAINED per-book state via
--- Bridge:peek_transport_books (a pre-existing, read-only introspection
--- API -- see orchestrator.lua's _state_for/_on_push_result, which
--- already track last_success_at/consecutive_failures for every push
--- attempt, on every transport, entirely independent of any of this).
--- Snapshot "cloud" transport's consecutive_failures for this book_file
--- immediately BEFORE dispatching, and again immediately after; if it
--- increased, the attempt that JUST happened failed, regardless of
--- do_cloud_upload's "dispatched" return. No changes needed anywhere in
--- Orchestrator/Bridge/Transport's actual push logic, and no dependency
--- on whether a given provider's push is synchronous or not: if the
--- state has not been updated yet by the time this checks (a genuinely
--- async provider), the increase simply is not observed here and this
--- falls back to the EXISTING behavior (treated as succeeded) -- a
--- strict improvement over always-succeeds, never a regression from it.

--- storage, rename can report success while not actually clearing the
--- source directory entry. Verify explicitly rather than trust the

--- Real-device bug:
--- for a book that has genuinely never been opened before, the .sdr
--- sidecar directory does not exist yet -- KOReader only creates it as
--- part of its own docsettings write, which happens later in the open
--- lifecycle (observed in the device log at close time, well after
--- onReaderReady, where apply_staged_prefetch runs). io.open does not
--- create parent directories, so Util.move_file's destination write
--- fails outright ("cannot open destination"), the whole move reports
--- failure, and the source correctly (if uselessly) stays in prefetch/
--- -- this was never a "lingering after a reported success" case, it
--- never succeeded at all. do_cloud_upload's own known-book path never
--- hits this because "known" already implies "opened before", so the
--- directory was always already there by the time it writes --
--- apply_staged_prefetch is the only canonical-storage writer that can
--- run before that directory exists at all. Module-level (not a local
--- closure inside apply_staged_prefetch) specifically so it is directly
--- unit-testable against a real missing directory -- this suite's
--- docsettings stub unconditionally creates the sidecar dir as a side
--- effect of resolving the path at all, which would otherwise mask

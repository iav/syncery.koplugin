-- =============================================================================
--
-- The "manual" Syncthing provider: reads the daemon's API key out of the
-- user's settings and builds its base URL from the loopback host plus the
-- stored scheme/port (no full URL is entered or stored any more).
--
-- This provider is what works WITHOUT the kosyncthing_plus plugin installed —
-- the user has a Syncthing daemon running ON THIS DEVICE (Termux, the desktop
-- app, etc.) and Syncery talks to it over REST on 127.0.0.1.  The host is the
-- loopback by construction: Syncery's progress files live on the local
-- filesystem, so the daemon that replicates them is necessarily local (a
-- remote daemon could not see those files to sync them).
--
-- A provider's job is narrow: produce a config table or signal
-- "I can't".  No HTTP calls, no caching, no policy.  The transport
-- layer decides what to do with the result.
--
-- INTERFACE
--
-- Every provider returned from this module has:
---   id()              → string         — stable internal id
---   get_config()      → table|nil      — config table, or nil if not ready
---   supports(cap)     → bool           — optional-capability check
---
--- The config table shape is what http_client expects to build on top of:
---   { url       = string,    -- computed "<scheme>://127.0.0.1:<port>"
---     api_key   = string,    -- the X-API-Key header value
---     folder_id = string,    -- default Syncthing folder id for this device
---     folders   = table|nil, -- list of {folder_id, path} for all folders,
---                              -- or nil if the provider can't enumerate
---   }
---
--- Settings keys (matched to legacy `syncery_syncthing_*` prefix so
--- we can drop syncery_syncthing.lua without burning user settings —
--- the values written by the legacy menu are still readable here):
---   syncery_syncthing_api_key    — API key (the one required field)
---   syncery_syncthing_port       — GUI port on 127.0.0.1 (optional; 8384 if absent)
---   syncery_syncthing_scheme     — "http" (default) or "https" (optional)
---   syncery_syncthing_folder_id  — default folder id (optional; "default" if absent)
---
--- DEPENDENCY INJECTION
---
--- The settings_reader is injected, not pulled from G_reader_settings
--- directly.  Tests pass a fake reader (`function(key) return data[key] end`);
--- production passes a thin wrapper around G_reader_settings.  Same
--- pattern as the orchestrator's clock and scheduler — the boundary
--- to "real globals" is exactly one line in the consumer.

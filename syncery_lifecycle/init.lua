-- =============================================================================
--
-- The Lifecycle dispatcher.  Wires the per-event KOReader handlers
-- (onCloseDocument, onSuspend, onResume, onPowerOff, onQuit, onFlushSettings)
-- onto the central Teardown helper, owns the Timers instance, and
-- exposes the small "schedule the autosave" wrapper that
-- `Syncery:scheduleAutoSave` delegates to.
--
-- This is a façade module: it doesn't reimplement any of the work; it
-- just routes the four+ KOReader events into the right `Teardown.flush`
-- opts and holds the Timers handle that teardown's Step 5 reaches.
--
-- WHY THE METHODS LIVE HERE (and not, say, as a flat events.lua)
--
-- Each handler is a 1–3-line decision: "what teardown opts does this
-- event want?"  Putting them on the dispatcher object means main.lua
-- carries one reference (self._lifecycle) and the handler-to-event
-- mapping is grep-able by method name.  The alternative — separate
-- events.lua holding four near-identical one-liners — would split
-- this knowledge across two files without buying anything.
--
-- CONSTRUCTION
--
-- Lifecycle.new builds and stores a Timers instance.  The plugin holds
-- onto the returned Lifecycle as `self._lifecycle`; its own `init()`
-- only constructs the Lifecycle once, and the timers slot map outlives
-- individual onReaderReady / onCloseDocument cycles (timers get
-- cancel_all'd on each teardown, but the Timers instance itself
-- stays).

-- Construction

-- opts.plugin     — the Syncery plugin instance.  Required.
-- opts.ui_manager — KOReader's UIManager.  Required.  We forward this
--                   to Timers (which calls :scheduleIn / :unschedule)
--                   and to Teardown (which calls :close / :nextTick).
-- opts.util_now   — function returning current Unix time.  Required.
--                   Threaded through to Teardown so the test suite can
--                   pin time.  In production main.lua wires this to
--                   `Util.now`.
-- opts.logger     — optional logger object exposing .warn(msg).  Used
--                   by both Timers and Teardown for soft errors.
--                   Falls back to a no-op for test contexts.

--

--- DOES broadcast Resume to plugins on wake (see on_resume below), the same

--- than tearing down, so on_resume has something to work with.

-- Resume re-check budget.  WiFi is usually off during suspend and reconnects
-- asynchronously over several seconds after a wake, so we cannot check the
-- moment we resume.  We re-probe connectivity every RESUME_RECHECK_POLL_DELAY
-- seconds, up to RESUME_RECHECK_MAX_TRIES times (~30s), then defer the actual
-- remote check by RESUME_RECHECK_GRACE seconds to let Syncthing pull the
-- peer's files (checkRemote only reads the locally-synced files).

local RESUME_RECHECK_PULL_FALLBACK = 20


--- onResume — device woke from suspend.  KOReader broadcasts Resume to
--- plugins (frontend/device/generic/device.lua), exactly as it broadcasts
--- Suspend (which on_suspend above handles) — so this fires on every wake.
--- The book stays open across suspend, so onReaderReady does NOT re-fire and
--- nothing else re-checks whether a peer advanced while we slept.  We re-check
--- here, but gate it on connectivity: checkRemote reads the locally-synced
--- files, which Syncthing can only have refreshed once WiFi is back.  So we
--- poll connectivity on a bounded budget, then defer the check by a short
--- grace.  Reuses the slot scheduler (so teardown's cancel_all stops it on a
--- quick close) and the same _check_remote_action slot onReaderReady uses (so
--- the two coalesce).  Does NOT re-initialise the plugin — an Event never
--- re-runs init(); on_suspend keeps us alive precisely so we are here now.

--- onSaveSettings — KOReader is persisting doc_settings.  Deliver the

--- Ordering (verified against KOReader source): this runs AFTER
--- ReaderAnnotation:onSaveSettings -- plugins are registered after the core
--- modules (readerui.lua), the core handler returns nil (does not stop the
--- SaveSettings broadcast), and no core module's onSaveSettings returns true,
--- so the broadcast reaches us last and our write overwrites the live-list
--- write ReaderAnnotation just made.  KOReader's onReadSettings then loads
--- the base key on the next open (+ annotations_externally_modified triggers
--- a pageno/sort recompute, set inside stage_pending_at_close).
---
--- No stash -> no-op.  The stash is filled only by the destroying teardown
--- path (close-document / quit), so suspend, autosave, power-off and every
--- other ordinary SaveSettings pass straight through.  The stash is consumed
--- exactly once (cleared before the write) so a second save in the same close
--- does not re-deliver.  See ANNOTATION_DELIVERY_DESIGN.md S2 / G-wiring.

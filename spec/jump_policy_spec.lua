-- Tests for syncery_ui/jump_policy.lua — the pure jump-prompt
-- decision extracted from main.lua:checkRemote.
--
-- This spec exists to LOCK the B8 fix: the old gate compared a remote
-- device's per-device save-count against THIS device's save-count
-- (`r_rev <= self.own_revision`), silently suppressing the cross-device
-- jump prompt whenever our save-count was higher.  The new policy keys
-- suppression per remote device by revision, with no notion of our own
-- counter — so a device that is behind us in save-count but ahead in the
-- book is still offered.  The "B8 regression lock" block below pins that.
--
-- Pure logic, no disk — but we still call h.setup for parity with the
-- other progress specs (defensive parent-package requires).

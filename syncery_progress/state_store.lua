--
-- WHAT THIS FILE DOES
--
-- It loads and saves the structured state for a book's reading
-- progress — the "syncery-progress.json" file (shared between devices) and
-- its private "progress.last-sync.json" companion.
--
-- Other modules in the progress subsystem call into this one to read
-- and write state.  This is the only place that knows about the
-- shape of the on-disk JSON.
--
--
-- THE FILE LAYOUT
--
-- The shared file ("syncery-progress.json" in hash mode) looks like:
--
--   {
--     "schema_version": 1,
--     "entries": {
--        "<device_a_id>": { revision, percent, page, total_pages,
--                           xpath, timestamp, label, file, ... },
--        "<device_b_id>": { ... },
--        ...
--     }
--   }
--
-- There is intentionally NO top-level device_id/device_label here.  The
-- "who last wrote" stamp is omitted so identical content from two
-- devices yields byte-identical files (no Syncthing churn) -- see
-- save_shared.  Per-device provenance lives inside each entry (`label`).
--
-- The last-sync file has the same shape, but represents "what was
-- in the shared file at the last successful sync" — and it lives in
-- Syncery's private state directory, never visible to Syncthing.
--
--
-- WHY ONE SECTION (`entries`), NOT THREE
--
-- Annotations had three sections (annotations / metadata /
-- render_settings) because three independently-evolving concerns
-- share the same on-disk file.  Progress has just one concern: the
-- reading-position-per-device map.  Keeping the wrapper structure
-- (`{ schema_version, entries }`) lets us add fields later without
-- another schema version bump.

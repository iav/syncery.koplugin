--
-- WHAT THIS FILE DOES
--
-- This is the top-level conductor of the annotation subsystem.  Every
-- other module in `syncery_ann/` is a building block; this is the one
-- that calls them in the right order to produce a complete sync.
--
-- One public function (`sync_book`) does the whole thing:
--
--   1. Resolve any Syncthing conflict files so we work with a single
--      coherent "remote" view.
--   2. Read three views: LOCAL (KOReader's doc_settings), REMOTE (the
--      shared JSON), LAST-SYNC (this device's private ancestor file).
--   3. Refuse to sync if local is empty and remote is full — the
--      "wipe failsafe" that prevents a fresh-open device from
--      destroying everyone else's annotations.
--   4. Run the 3-way merge on annotations, the field-by-field merge
--      on metadata, and the whole-block merge on render settings.
--   5. Garbage-collect tombstones older than the configured TTL.
--   6. Push the merged state BACK into KOReader (so the user sees the
--      latest annotations from all devices) AND out to the shared file
--      (so other devices see this device's contributions).
--   7. Save the merged state as the new last-sync ancestor for next
--      time.
--
-- All errors are collected into a result table rather than thrown.
-- The caller can decide what to do with them (log, surface to UI,
-- silently retry).
--
--
-- WHY ONE BIG FUNCTION (NOT SEVEN SMALL ENDPOINTS)
--
-- The phases are tightly ordered and share a lot of intermediate
-- state (the merged map gets used three times: for KOReader, for the
-- shared file, for last-sync).  Splitting them would mean either
-- passing a huge context object between calls or duplicating the
-- read steps.  Both worse than the long-but-linear orchestrator.
--
-- For testing, the orchestrator takes its dependencies as injected
-- "providers" so a test can hand it a fake KOReader, fake disk
-- modules, fake clock.  See `sync_book_with_providers` at the bottom.
--
--
-- ATOMICITY
--
-- There is no transactional guarantee that all three writes (shared
-- JSON, last-sync JSON, KOReader doc_settings) happen together.  If
-- the device dies between writes, we may end up with the shared file
-- updated but last-sync stale — which means the next sync will treat
-- some already-merged remote annotations as "new from remote" again.
-- That's safe (idempotent merge gives the same result), just slightly
-- wasteful.  We never end up with DATA LOSS from a partial sync — at
-- worst we redo work.

--- Build the annotation map to write into the LAST-SYNC ancestor, filtered
--- so that an un-materialized remote pull never enters the ancestor.
---
--- WHY THIS EXISTS (the phantom-tombstone window):
--- The last-sync file is the ancestor the next 3-way merge diffs against.
--- `merge._detect_local_deletions` iterates the ancestor: a key present in
--- the ancestor but ABSENT from the live local list is read as "the user
--- deleted it" and tombstoned.  That is correct for a key the user actually
--- had locally.  But a freshly PULLED annotation (adopted into `merged` from
--- the remote, yet never materialized into this device's live list -- it
--- only reaches the live list at the NEXT book open, via the close-time
--- delivery) is NOT in the local read.  If we wrote the full merged map into
--- the ancestor, the very next merge would see "ancestor has it, local does
--- not" and synthesize a PHANTOM deletion of an annotation the user never
--- touched.
---
--- The fix: a live (non-deleted) entry enters the ancestor only if its key
--- was in THIS merge's local read (i.e. it is materialized on this device).
--- Tombstones ALWAYS enter the ancestor -- a deletion must stay known so it
--- is not resurrected.  Un-materialized pulls are excluded; the next merge
--- then sees them as remote-only (adopt again, alive), never as a deletion.
---
--- This does NOT break real deletion detection: a key the user genuinely had
--- locally WAS in the local read, so it is kept in the ancestor; when the
--- user later deletes it, its absence is correctly read as a deletion.
---
--- @param merged table The merged annotation map (alive entries + tombstones).
--- @param local_annotations table The local read this merge diffed against.
--- @return table The filtered map to persist as the last-sync ancestor.

--
-- WHAT THIS FILE DOES
--
-- It reads and writes the per-book rendering preferences — font face,
-- font size, line spacing, font weight, page margins — between KOReader's
-- doc_settings and Syncery's `render_settings` section of the annotations
-- JSON.
--
-- This whole module is opt-in AND per-field.  By default NOTHING is
-- synced: the master toggle (`sync_render_settings`) is off, and even
-- when it is on, each individual field has its own sub-toggle that is
-- also off by default.  Render settings are device-specific by nature
-- (a font size or margin comfortable on a phone is wrong on a large
-- e-reader), so the user opts in to exactly the fields they want.
--
--
-- THE REAL KOReader KEYS
--
-- KOReader stores the reflowable render settings through the Configurable
-- mechanism under a "copt_" prefix (Configurable:saveSettings writes
-- `prefix..key`, prefix "copt_").  The font FACE is the exception: it is
-- owned by ReaderFont and stored as a top-level "font_face" key.  So the
-- actual doc_settings keys are:
--
--   * font_face              — ReaderFont, top-level "font_face" (string)
--   * font_size              — "copt_font_size"
--   * line_spacing           — "copt_line_spacing"
--   * font_weight            — "copt_font_base_weight"
--   * margins                — "copt_h_page_margins" + "copt_t_page_margin"
--                              + "copt_b_page_margin" (three keys, grouped
--                              under one toggle)
--
--
-- PER-FIELD MERGE (changed from whole-block)
--
-- Each synced render key is its own merge unit, carried in the JSON as
--   { "<key>": { value = ..., datetime_updated = "..." }, ... }
-- with NO top-level block timestamp.  merge() picks the newer entry per
-- key (newer datetime_updated wins; an exact-timestamp tie is broken on the
-- canonical VALUE fingerprint, a device-independent / commutative rule),
-- preserving a key present on only one side — identical in shape and
-- semantics to MetadataBridge.merge.  This lets render fields from different
-- devices ACCUMULATE: change font size on one device and margins on another,
-- and both survive (the old whole-block merge kept only the newest device's
-- block, dropping the other's changes).
--
-- The merge function is the SINGLE source of render-merge truth, called
-- by all three paths (the Syncthing orchestrator, the cloud adapter, and
-- the sidecar conflict resolver) — mirroring how MetadataBridge.merge is
-- shared, so the three paths cannot diverge.
--
--
-- BYTE-IDENTITY
--
-- The per-field shape is exactly what MetadataBridge already uses inside
-- the same canonical envelope, which is byte-identical across devices
-- (json_store sort_keys + no device stamp + a pure merge).  Two devices
-- that converge to the same logical render state serialize to identical
-- bytes because: (a) the merge is COMMUTATIVE (per-field newer-wins, and an
-- exact-timestamp tie is broken on the value fingerprint, not on argument
-- order) so merge(local,remote) and merge(remote,local) reach the SAME
-- entries on both devices; (b) the per-field change detection fingerprints
-- each value, so the SAME value never earns a spurious new timestamp on one
-- device.  (A bare ">=" / argument-order tie-break failed (a): each device
-- passes its own block first, so on a same-second concurrent edit each kept
-- its own value and the shared file never converged -- Syncthing churn.)
--
--
-- WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT
--
-- apply_from_remote writes the values into doc_settings; KOReader picks
-- them up on the NEXT open of the book (ReaderFont / the crengine
-- Configurable load their settings at load time).  We do NOT live
-- re-render — the merge structure never reaches KOReader; apply unwraps
-- each entry's `.value` and writes the plain value KOReader expects.
--
--
-- ROLLING DOCS ONLY
--
-- Render settings on paging documents (PDF, DJVU, CBZ) don't translate
-- meaningfully — a margin in crengine units is meaningless on a fixed
-- page.  We skip paging docs entirely.

--- Apply a remote render block to KOReader's doc_settings, per field.
---
--- A field is applied only if its remote entry is strictly newer than
--- what this device's cached state last saw for that key (the echo /
--- stale guard), and only if its sub-toggle is on.  Each entry's
--- `.value` is UNWRAPPED and the plain value is written to doc_settings
--- (KOReader never sees the per-field wrapper).  Each written value is also
--- mirrored into the live module state (see _update_live_state) so KOReader's
--- onSaveSettings does not clobber it before the next open; the change takes
--- effect on the next open of the book (no live re-render, by design).
---
--- After writing a render key to doc_settings, mirror the value into the
--- live in-memory state that KOReader's onSaveSettings will persist on
--- close/flush/suspend -- otherwise that save writes the unchanged live
--- state back over our doc_settings write before the next open, and the
--- synced setting silently vanishes.
---
--- Two owners:
---   * `font_face` is held by ReaderFont (ui.font.font_face) and written
---     back by ReaderFont:onSaveSettings.
---   * every `copt_<name>` key is held in the document's shared Configurable
---     (ui.document.configurable[<name>]) and written back by
---     ReaderConfig:onSaveSettings.
--- Guarded throughout: the live modules may be absent (e.g. the book is
--- not the open document, or in the headless suite).  We deliberately do
--- NOT re-render here -- the design applies render changes on next open,
--- not live; this only keeps the persisted value from being clobbered.
